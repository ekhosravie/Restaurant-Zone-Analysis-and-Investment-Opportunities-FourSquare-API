Restaurant Zone Analysis and Investment Opportunities
This project performs a detailed analysis of restaurant data across multiple zones to identify potential investment opportunities. It uses the Foursquare API to gather data, processes it with Python, and visualizes insights through interactive charts. Key features include clustering restaurant categories, calculating saturation rates, and identifying the best zones for new restaurant investments.

Features
Data Collection:

Fetches restaurant data from the Foursquare API for specified zones.
Captures details such as zone, restaurant name, latitude, longitude, and category.
Clustering:

Utilizes K-Means clustering to group restaurants by category for better understanding of market distribution.
Saturation Analysis:

Computes the saturation rate for each zone and category to highlight areas with high or low restaurant density.
Investment Opportunities:

Identifies under-saturated zones and categories suitable for new restaurant investments.
Interactive Visualizations:

Creates scatter maps, bar charts, and stacked bar charts using Plotly for intuitive data exploration.
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/restaurant-analysis.git
